# Forecasting-Energy-Market-Series-Using-Econometric-Models-and-Machine-Learning-Techniques-
This study is dedicated to comparing different modeling and forecasting techniques 
applied to energy markets, specifically crude oil for the American and natural gas for 
European and Asian market prices and volatility. Furthermore, we are incorporating 
machine learning models such as random forests, gradient boosting, long short-term 
memory networks, and temporal fusion transformers in the prediction process, 
evaluating the impact of those over more traditional linear econometric techniques like 
regression models with autocorrelated errors and conditional heteroscedasticity 
components. Through out-of-sample testing, we confirmed the importance of event 
indicators, the consistency of shocks in model prediction, and the promising accuracy 
of self-attention models in energy market time series.
